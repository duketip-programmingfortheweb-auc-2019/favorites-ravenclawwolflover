<p>Fireheart used to be a kittypet, but he joined Thunderclan after the leader asked him. There weren't enough warriors to hunt and defend their territory, so their leader had to find more. He had to fight to prove his worth in his clan, which thought he was soft and weak because he used to be a kittypet.</p>
<h4>SPOILER ALERT</h4>
<p>Fireheart discovers a murderous traitor in Thunderclan, Tigerclaw. Fireheart drives Tigerclaw out of Thunderclan, but he joins another clan, Shadowclan, and becomes its leader, getting the leader name of Tigerstar. Fireheart becomes the leader of Thunderclan when its leader dies, and earns the leader name of Firestar. Firestar has to team up with the clan Windclan to defeat Tigerstar and his evil army of rogue cats.</p>
