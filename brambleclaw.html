<p>Brambleclaw is chosen to fulfill a mysterious prophecy. He must go on a journey with cats of other clans to the mysterious "sun-drown place", the ocean, to receive a message from Starclan.</p>
<h4>SPOILER ALERT</h4>
<p>Brambleclaw (who is Tigerstar's son) and the others find a badger named Midnight who tells them that the Clans must move away from their home because it is being destroyed by Twolegs (humans). It takes some persuasion, but eventually all the clans agree to make the Great Journey and move to a new home around a lake. When they get there, though, Brambleclaw discovers that his half-brother, Hawkfrost, who is also Tigerstar's son, is evil. Brambleclaw has to stop him from murdering Firestar and kills him in a fight to protect the Clans.</p>
