<p>Jayfeather is a blind cat who has the superpower to read other cats' minds and walk in their dreams. He is one of the cats in the mysterious Prophecy of Three that Firestar heard, which gave three of Firestar's relatives superpowers.</p>
<h4>SPOILER ALERT</h4>
<p>He and his siblings, Lionblaze and Hollyleaf, have powers. Jayfeather can read minds and walk in dreams and Lionblaze has super strength, but Hollyleaf can't figure out what her power is. They try to discover their powers and figure out how to use them. However, their life is forever changed when they find out that they are adopted and their real parents were from different clans, which meant their romance was forbidden. Driven insane, Hollyleaf runs away and gets wounded and lost deep in a tunnel. Everyone thinks she is dead. But, it is then revealed that the real third cat of the prophecy is actually their neice Dovewing who has super senses. Dovewing, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather find Hollyleaf alive. Then, all of Thunderclan, led by the three superpowered cats, fights against a group of evil ghosts, including Tigerstar and Hawkfrost, to save the clans.</p>
